        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Tami Lake. I am a graduate from the University of Miami, where I received a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art and Computer Science. While I was still developing my voice and point of view, I had my hands in a variety of techniques and mediums. I have studied printmaking, photography, and graphic design. I have developed a fully functional platform game using the Unity Game Engine. Also, I was a producer, director, and animator for a short animated film created in Autodesk Maya. I am looking for a career where I can utilize my differing talents. Check out the tabs at the right for more information about me and some examples of my work.</p>
